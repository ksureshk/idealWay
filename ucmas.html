            <p>UCMAS is a mental arithmetic program where the children can able to untap their potential through this course. It is considered as a brain gym to enhance their skills in their right age.  By learning to perform mental calculations quickly and accurately, students aged between 4 to 13 years can expand their mental capacity and develop skills. Abacus is a boon for the children which enables them to improve the brain power. Children love to play, we encourage them to do so. Our endeavor is to make UCMAS Abacus an enjoyable & memorable experience for our children. Your Child should get:<br>

			 •    Strengthen Maths skill <br>
			 •    The UCMAS approach promotes whole brain development and establishes foundational building blocks like memory, concentration, creativity and problem solving – core skills that inspire greater confidence and success in all subject areas. </p>

                    REVEALED THROUGH UCMAS:
                </div>

                <div class="content-box" style="">There is no limit to the potentialities of the human brain. Not only does the function of the human brain need cultivating from childhood, but also need to be constantly used throughout. UCMAS is a tool for brain development program. The harmonious action between the organs of human body and limbs, especially the triggering of “image in brain” is the promoter of tapping the function of the brain in mental arithmetic by Zhusuan. A lot of physiological organs of human body are divided into left and right parts. Some of them appear symmetric on the surface, but the functions are not symmetric at all. For instance the right and left hands are different in strength and skill.</div>
            </div>
			
			<p>Research on brain science reveals that the left hemisphere provides analytical information processing and is at good dealing with information concerning language and sound; the right hemisphere provides integral information processing and is good at dealing with information concerning the shape and space. The different cognitive forms of the two hemispheres are mutually complementary and co-operative and develop harmoniously, making up the whole function of human brain. Left-brain governs the right limbs and the right one, the left. Conversely the action of the limbs also has an influence on the development of the brain. Human beings by heredity and education are accustomed to using the right hand in the early years. The right hand is used more than left hand throughout life, so the right brain function is not fully developed.</p>

			<p>In order to explore and develop the potentialities of the human brain fully, many physiologists and brain scientist have been studying ways to develop the function of the right brain further. UCMAS is the result of such research. It is the child education on mental arithmetic by image of Zhusuan that solves the problem. Numerous examples prove that people who learn abacus Mental Arithmetic since childhood are more outstanding in intelligence, academics and overall behavior.</p>

			<p>Wishing you a very bright future together!!!!!</p>

			<div class="sub-title font-color-s-light">
                    STRUCTURE OF UCMAS:
            </div>
			<p>For the first six months of the program the child is familiarized and made to operate the abacus. The beads on the abacus represent numbers and the central and the vertical rods provide additional value to the beads. The movement of the beads towards the central beam on a particular rod forms a picture and simultaneously a mathematical value. This association of the value or amount with the image of the bead formation on the abacus is imprinted into the child's mind.</p>
			
			<div style="padding-left:50px">
			<p>a. FLASH CARDS: are used to enhance the visuals and help them memorize the pictures. By the end of the program they have 450,000 images stored in their memory. </p>
			<p>b. ORALS: are used to foster their capability of listening skills excellent. They can enlarge their listening power by using some fraction of seconds memorize more numbers.</p>
			<p>c. SPEED WRITING: is the method we approach to amplify their speed in a seconds calculation in their writing skills.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>With the above methods, they child can express their like and creative skills.</p>

			<p>Once they perfect their ability to recall these images and convert them into numbers, they are ready to attempt sums mentally with the help of the abacus — and without it after some time. It's possible to learn addition, subtraction, multiplication, exponents, factors and percentage on the abacus.</p>

			<p>There's one more skill which gets honed as they learn the UCMAS. Using both hands to rapidly work on the beads on the abacus helps children to improve their motor skills, says Wong.</p>

			<p>Moreover, their skill of picking up the "visual" aspects and process them improves, while mental maths only perks up their concentration and hearing.</p>
