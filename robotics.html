            <p>Robotics is the branch of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots. In this professional course, we are focusing children aged 4-13 years to learn based on their age group. We are enlightening them about the basics of robotic assemble, principles of electrical and electronic structure. Children can build and program many different functional robots.   Robotics for Kids uses fun, hands-on projects to get your child’s creative juices flowing. Your child will learn how to build and program robots with LEGO bricks and software, all while making friends, developing new skills and having a great time with STEM. For many kids, robotics class is a highlight of their week.</p>
			<p>We have several kid’s robotics programs available to fully engage and challenge your aspiring engineer, computer programmer or scientist. A great way to learn STEM!!!!</p>

                    How we teach kids robotics (weekly):
                </div>

                <div class="content-box" style="">
				<p>In each Robotics for Kids class, your child and a buddy work together to plan and build a new robot using LEGO bricks, letting their creativity and imaginations loose. Along the way, they learn science and engineering concepts, such as how pulleys, levers and motors work.</p>
				
				<p>As the kids’ robots take shape, they experiment with LEGO. They discover how to apply computer programming concepts and find new ways to get their “bot” moving.</p>
				
				<p>Then, the energy levels (and smiles) really reach a high point, as the kids challenge other teams to friendly games or take part in imaginative play.</p>
				
				<p>At the end of each robotics class, your child enjoys a wrap-up activity to reinforce the STEM skills he or she learned in class.</p>
